  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can reserve a screen 
    name for any of the JNCO chatrooms by registering a screen name of your choice. 
    Registering that name with us means that for the next 30 days, no one else 
    can use that name. This eliminates the problem of "posers".</font></p>

<p><font color="#99CCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>How Do 
  I Change My Registered Name?</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently there are 2 
    ways to change your name:<br>
    <br>
    1) Simple: Just fool your browser into thinking you are in another chat room. 
    To do this use an extra '/' somewhere in the address you use to get to our 
    chat room. For example, instead of going to http://www.jnco.com/chat, go to 
    http://www.jnco.com//chat. Your browser will think that it is at a different 
    address, and not tell the chat room who you are, allowing you to re-register 
    if you wish.<br>
    <br>
    2) More difficult: Destroy the cookie your browser uses to identify you. This 
    would prevent you from using your old name for a couple of weeks until I clean 
    the name out of the registry database. <br>
    <br>
    To do this just click <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000419034412fw_/http://jnco.com:80/chat/chat1/killCookie.cgi" target="_parent">erase screen name</a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    There is another one located at www.jnco.com/chat/chatgroove/killCookie.cgi 
    for any cookie you may have set there. After visiting the Cookie Eater(s), 
    close your browser, and restart it. If you see your old name still there, 
    hit the refresh button before posting a message.<br>
    <br>
    Finally, if you still have trouble with either of these methods, go to www.jnco.com/chat/chatgroove, 
    and ask somebody there to help you. Frequently, the users there are savvy 
    enough to know these "secret" tricks. </font></p>

<p><font color="#99CCFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>Why Does 
  the Graffifi Wall Loose My Registration?</b></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You seem to have a promiscuous 
    browser. To register, it must accept a <font color="#FFFF99"><i><font color="#FFFF99">"cookie"</font></i></font> 
    from the chat room. That is a little bit of information that your browser 
    stores on your hard drive. Whenever it accesses the graffiti wall, it then 
    gives the cookie back to the chat room. The chat room reads the cookie and 
    learns who you are. The problem happens when the browser deletes the cookie. 
    The reason is usually because most browsers refuse to accept more than 300 
    cookies. Some roughish pages will send you as many as 7 or more cookies per 
    page. It your cookie quota is full, your browser will delete some of your 
    old cookies to make room for the new ones. Then, when you go back to the graffiti 
    wall, no cookie, no registration. The wall knows that somebody registered 
    under the old name, and will not let anybody else do it. <br>
    <br>
    <b>The solution:</b> Set you browsers options to ask you permission before 
    accepting cookies. Then, only accept cookies that you want, and do not accept 
    cookies from sites that only want to study your browsing habits.<br>
    <br>
    Use the escape button or click <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"no"</i></font> before 
    accepting cookies that have nothing to do with anything you want. In any event, 
    your privacy is important, and these businesses and government pages should 
    not be tracking your browsing habits.<br>
    <br>
    Okay, a <b>cacheing problem</b> may also be to blame. Just hit the refresh 
    button, and the page would give you back your old name if that is the case.<br>
    <br>
    I could fix the problem using passwords, but that would require a faster version 
    of the chat room. Due to other priorities, it will probably be a while before 
    I can go back to that project. Sorry for the problems.<br>
    <br>
    To change options for IE explorer, choose: <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"options"</i></font> 
    from the <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"View"</i></font> menu. Select the <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"Advanced"</i></font> 
    tab from the Options dialog box. The last item under <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"Warnings"</i></font> 
    should be 'Warn before accepting <font color="#FFFF99"><i>"cookies"</i></font>'. 
    Make sure there is a check in its box. In fact, all of the boxes there should 
    be checked. </font></p>
